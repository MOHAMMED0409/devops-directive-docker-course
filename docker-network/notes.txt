Bridge Network:

    $ docker network create -d bridge my-bridge-net
    
    In bridge networking to make containers communicate with outside world port maping is done.
    
    As an example, consider you can have a Docker container running a web service on port  80  . 
    Because this container is attached to the bridge network on a private subnet, 
    a port on the host system like  8000  needs to be mapped to port  80 on the container 
    for outside traffic to reach the web service.

Overlay Network:

    An overlay network driver is used for multi-host network communication.
    
    Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) technology which provide portability between cloud, 
    on-premise and virtual environments.
    
    Extending layer 2 subnets across layer 3 network boundaries, 
    hence containers can run on foreign IP subnets.

    For example:
        $ docker network create -d overlay --subnet=192.168.10.0/24 my-overlay-net

Macvlan Network:

    It is used to connect Docker containers directly to the host network interfaces through 
    layer 2 segmentation.

    Latency in macvlan networks is low since packets are routed directly from Docker host 
    network interface controller (NIC) to the containers.

    For Example:
        $ docker network create -d macvlan \
          --subnet=192.168.40.0/24 \
          --gateway=192.168.40.1 \
          -o parent=eth0 my-macvlan-net

Docker communicate with each other:

    Docker will assign a name and hostname to each container created on the default docker0 network, 
    unless a different name/hostname is specified by the user.
